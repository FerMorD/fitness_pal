Only files I have added/changed are pubspec.yaml, and everything in lib. The other files were created by the template for Flutter.

Files:

- main.dart                     //
- home_page.dart                // Home-Page UI
- library_page.dart             // Library-Page UI
- profile_page.dart             // Profile-Page UI
- workout_page.dart             // Workout-Page UI
- library_workouts.dart         // Where the workouts created are stored
- workout_database.dart         // Where specific excercises are
